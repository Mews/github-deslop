# GitHub De-slop

Browser extension to hide some Copilot stuff on GitHub that I find annoying.

## Effects
- Hide the Copilot text box from the [GitHub home page](https://github.com/).
- Hide the Copilot text box from the [GitHub dashboard page](https://github.com/dashboard).

> Feel free to suggest anything else you'd like to see changed or removed :p

## Installing
Go to the [releases page](https://github.com/Mews/github-deslop/releases) download the `.zip` file (normal for chrome, edge, opera or other chromium based browsers, -firefox for Firefox) and extract it.

Then you can install it using the developer mode as an upacked extension.
