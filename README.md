# github-unslop

Hide some Copilot stuff on GitHub that I find annoying.

## Effects
- Hide the Copilot text box from the [GitHub home page](https://github.com/).
- Hide the Copilot text box from the [GitHub dashboard page](https://github.com/dashboard).

> Feel free to suggest anything else that should be hidden.
