# GitHub De-slop

Browser extension to hide some Copilot stuff on GitHub that I find annoying.

## Effects
- Hide the Copilot text box from the [GitHub home page](https://github.com/).
- Hide the Copilot text box from the [GitHub dashboard page](https://github.com/dashboard).

> Feel free to suggest anything else you'd like to see changed or removed :p

## Installing
Go to the [releases page](https://github.com/Mews/github-deslop/releases) and download the `.xpi` file for Firefox, or the `.zip` file (and extract it) for any browser. 

Then you can install it using the developer mode.
